## How to Use This Template

cd portfolio-template
```
### Step 2: Configure Your Site with a Pages Theme
Open the `config.yml` file.
Update placeholders like your name, description, and social media links.

You can see a list of available free themes [here](https://pages.github.com/themes/). There are also paid themes available out there, but I would recommend just starting with one of these free ones for simplicity. 

### Step 3: Update the Content
Replace the placeholders in `TEMPLATE.md` with your personal details, projects, and other relevant information.
Add your images and styles to the `/assets` folder.
Rename the file `README.md`.

### Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Push your changes to a GitHub repository.
Go to the repository settings.
Enable GitHub Pages under the "Pages" section and select the branch containing your site files (e.g., main).

### Step 5: Customize Further

Add or update projects in TEMPLATE.md as needed.
